## Random walk in x8086 Assembly language


The random walk program is written in x8086 Assembly language two generate random steps (either increased or decreased by 1) in x- and y-axis. The user can specify the number of random steps to perform.

To simulate the code, you can download the DOSBox emulator. After downloading the code, place it in the disk C (for example).

To execute the code, you execute the following commands in the DOSBox environment:
- mount c c:/
- c:/
- dir
- masm randomwalk.asm (Press enter multiple times; ignore messages)
- link randomwalk.obj (Press enter multiple times; ignore messages)
- debug randomwalk.exe (Press enter multiple times; ignore messages)
- g

You can watch the tutorials on how to run .asm files via the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FqV3SHFlGQ&ab_channel=KhandakerReazMahmud

Good luck!
